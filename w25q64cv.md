##functional descriptions

>### spi operation
>> stardard spi instruction
>>> mode 0: clk is low on the falling and rising edges of /cs

>>> mode 3: clk is high on the falling and rising edges of /cs


>> hold
>>> may be used in cases where the spi data and clock signal are shared with other devices.

>>>/cs must to low to initiate /hold

>>>the falling edge to activate the /hold when the clk is ready
>
>>>the rising edge to close the /hold when the clk is ready
>
>>> and the /cs must to be low

>### write protection

>>the device write-disable after power-up,the wel must to be set before write,the wel automatically to clear after writing.
>
>>use srp0 srp1 bits to set status register protect
> 
>>use CMP SEC TB BP2~BP0 bits to set block protect.
>
>>conjinction with /wp pin.
>
>>further information in status register section
>
>> the device maintain the reset when the vcc is below the threshold value of vwi.

>###status register

>>default: the status register bits are all 0.

>>busy
>>>(s0) it is the read only bit to indicate page program sector erase,block erase,chip erase whether compete or not.
>
>>SEC(sector/block protect bit)
>>>sec=1=>4k sectors
>
>>>>sec=0=>64k blocks
>
>>CMP(complement protect bit)
>>> for instantce,when the cpm=0, a top 4k sector is protected,but when cmp=1,the top 4k sector is unprotected, ane the rest of array is read only.
>
>###instruction

>>****

>>when the memory is being programed or erased , or status register is written,all instruction except for read status register will be ingnored until program or erase cycle has completed.


>>**clock edge**
>>>the rising edge:write to device

>>>the falling edge:read from device

>>**1.write enable(06h)**
>>>to set WEL to 1 in status register

>>**2.write enable for volatile status register(50h)**
>>>it has to write this instruction before (write status register 01h)

>>>not set the write enable latch

>>**3.write disable(04h)**
>>>automatically to clear wel bit after operation

>>it can be used to invalidate the (write enable for valatile status register instruction)

>>**4.read status register-1(05h) and read status register-2(35h)**

>>>it may be used at any time

>>**5.write status register(01h)**

>>>only non-volatile status register bits can be written
>
>>>LB[3:1] are non-volatile OTP bits,once it is set to 1,it can't be clear.
>
>>>write enable instruction before it
>
>>>to write non-volatile bits,the write enable for volatile status register instruction has to be performed before it.

>>>the volatile bits will be lost after power-off.

>>**6. read data(03h)**

>>>format:03h, 24-bits address, 

>>>the instruction is competed by drving /cs high.

>>>it will be ignored if an erase,program or write cycle is in process.

>>**7. fast read(0bh)**

>>>add dummy clock to get higher clock to read data.
>
>>**8. fast read dual output(3BH)** 
>
>>>data is output on two pins.(IO0,IO1)
